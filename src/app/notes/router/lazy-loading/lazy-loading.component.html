      <h2>Preloading</h2>
      
      Although lazy loading improves the initial load time of an application, it can cause performance and UX depending on how big a particular module 
      that needs to be loaded is. Preloading is used with Lazy Loading for a better user experience.

      Preloading means angular preloads any modules that must be immediately available to the application. When the application compiles, it will compile the main `javascript` bundle required 
      for the initial landing page, and then it will asynchronously load the bundles that have been marked to be loaded in the background.

      Preloading happens in two ways: 

      <br>
      <ol>
        <li>No modules are preloaded (default)</li>
        <li>All modules are preloaded</li>
      </ol>
